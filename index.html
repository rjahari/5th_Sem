        <p>
          Being one of the oldest Technical Institute in the North East, Assam Engineering Institute placed an important
          role in the field of technical education in the region. The Institute was first started as “Assam Civil
          Engineering School” and offered a diploma course in Civil Engineering. Gradually as the demand for technical
          personal in other fields was increasing, diploma courses were introduced in other disciplines: Electrical,
          Mechanical, Chemical, Electronics & Telecommunication and Computer.
